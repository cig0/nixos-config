# TODO_ Add description of the module to the rest of the default.nix modules.

/*
  This module is a sidecar of `module-loades`:
  - Defines what directories `module-loader` will recursively scan; the default value is `dir = ./.`
  - Allows to exclude directories
  - Allows to import specific modules. This is specially useful when you have to exclude a path, but
  still want to import some of the modules from there.

  Running `module-loader` from a different location by declaring a different path for `dir` may
  cause unexpected behavior. I performed some simple tests and everything worked as expected, yet
  that deviates from the original design idea for `module-loader`.

  For more details, see the README.md.
