  TODO: polish the packages lists in a way that makes it easier to maintain and update them for their roles.
  Particularly packagesBaseline, it is becoming an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink list.

  Hint: How to pin a package to a specific version
  To pin a package to a specific version, use the following syntax:
   (Your_Package_Name.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {
      src = fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "NixOS";
        repo = "nixpkgs";
        rev = "the commit hash";
        hash = "the sha265 hash of the tarball";
      };
    }))

  To get the commit hash check the packages repository and look for the package in the correct channel branch, e.g. nixpkgs-unstable:
  https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixpkgs-unstable/pkgs/by-name/aw/awscli2/package.nix => https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/62fcc798988975fab297b87345d93919cd6f6389
  To get the sha256 hash of a package, run the following command:
  nix-prefetch-github NixOS nixpkgs --no-deep-clone -v --rev The_Commit_Hash
  Nix-prefetch-github can be installed as a normal package, or invoked on-demand if using `comma` (https://github.com/nix-community/comma, available in the official repositories.
  Of course it can also be installed with `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix-prefetch-github`, or temporarily with nix-shell.
