This branch tracks the clean-up job to consolidate coding practices, defined mySystem options, modules rename when applicable, and the documentation of a proper naming pattern for mySystem options, i.e.:

- mySystem.myOptions: any options not matching NixOS built-in options resides under this attribute set. This is to differentiate options created by my, from those that follows NixOS' options sets.
- mySystem.myOptions or mySystem.options, for short?
- mySystem.{programs,environment, lib (like in the krew.nix WIP),` etc.}: this pattern is used whenever I need to create an option that overlaps with an existing NixOS option.

myOptions:
- cli: settings related to CLI applications and shell
- hardware: settings related to hardware information, like setting CPU or GPU hardware
- nixos: settings related to NixOS itself, like channelPkgs to travers between channels
