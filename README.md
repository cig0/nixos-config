TODO:
- Migrate apps-cargo function to the systemd unit
- Migrate .config/yakuakerc configuration to a Home Manager module (also check the Nix KDE project)
- .netrc / token
- nearsk/cargo (on Grok)
- We have a new rabbit hole to explore: flake-utils (and possbily a new flake refactor on the horizon, yay!)

This branch tracks the clean-up job to consolidate coding practices, defined mySystem options, modules rename when applicable, and the documentation of a proper naming pattern for mySystem options, i.e.:

- mySystem.myOptions: any options not matching NixOS built-in options resides under this attribute set. This is to differentiate options created by my, from those that follows NixOS' options sets.
- mySystem.myOptions or mySystem.options, for short?
- mySystem.{programs,environment, lib (like in the krew.nix WIP),` etc.}: this pattern is used whenever I need to create an option that overlaps with an existing NixOS option.

myOptions:
- cli: settings related to CLI applications and shell
- environment: useful to set shell environment variables
- hardware: settings related to hardware information, like setting CPU or GPU hardware
- kernel: settings related to the kernel or kernel components
- nixos: settings related to NixOS itself, like channelPkgs to traverse between channels
