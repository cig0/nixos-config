# Treat hosts as cattle, not as a pet. The only important thing is the flake. The flake rule us. We obey the flake. The flake is the only source of authotority. All praises to the flake!
# [ ] Drop hand-picked hostnames and use the Type of the host instead, e.g. laptop, desktop, homelab => isLaptop, isDesktop, isHomeLab, etc.
# [ ] Replace all references to "Server" for "HomeLab" as it's more accurate.
