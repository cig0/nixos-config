# READ ME!
# =======

# To pin a package to a specific version, use the following syntax:
#  (Your_Package_Name.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {
#     src = fetchFromGitHub {
#       owner = "NixOS";
#       repo = "nixpkgs";
#       rev = "the commit hash";
#       hash = "the sha265 hash of the tarball";
#     };
#   }))

# To get the commit hash check the packages repository and look for the package in the correct channel branch, e.g. nixpkgs-unstable:
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixpkgs-unstable/pkgs/by-name/aw/awscli2/package.nix => https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/62fcc798988975fab297b87345d93919cd6f6389

# To get the sha256 hash of a package, run the following command:
# nix-prefetch-github NixOS nixpkgs --no-deep-clone -v --rev The_Commit_Hash

# Nix-prefetch-github can be installed as a normal package, or invoked on-demand if using `comma` (https://github.com/nix-community/comma, available in the official repositories.
# Of course it can also be installed with `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix-prefetch-github`, or temporarily with nix-shell.
