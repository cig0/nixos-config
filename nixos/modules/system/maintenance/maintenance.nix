# ========
# Q: Why do I defice two mutually-exclusive ways to update my NixOS systems (nh and NixOS built-in update option)?
# A: I like to have options. You can choose the one that fits your preferences. Moreover, I want to achieve a modular and dynamic configuration of the flake, that allows to change its behavior at build time by passing the corresponding options.
# I added safety measures to prevent enabling multiple configurations at a time.
