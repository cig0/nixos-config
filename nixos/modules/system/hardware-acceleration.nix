  pkgs, # TODO: I should consider an abstraction layer for pkgs to make it easier to switch between the stable and unstable release channel for the base system in case I need to. By hard-coding below `pkgs.intel-vaapi-driver.override` (similarly as I do in a few of other modules), I risk from collision of packages to make my NixOS generation way bigger than necessary. By implementing here an alternative input, e.g. `currentChannelInUse.intel-vaapi-driver.override`, I could easily switch between the stable and unstable release channel for the base system while ensuring the change would cascade to all the appropriate places. I should also create an option to easily manage currentChannelInUse from a host-options.nix file.
